    "content": "A few years ago we were searching for a new browser and WebView that could be regularly updated. We choose to use Chromium. In an attempt to limit privacy leaks to third parties, we decided to also include the patches from the <a href=\"https://github.com/bromite/bromite\">Bromite project</a>. Not many of you will notice the updates. This is because, as an exception, we use a prebuilt version (building Chromium can take up to 6-8 hours). This version is built by us and uploaded to <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/omnirom/android_packages_apps_OmniChromium/-/tree/android-10\">Gitlab</a>. This however prevents new versions appearing in update lists generated from Gerrit. But rest assured, we will keep Chromium updated.",
